# FGFS201831-METAR-patch
Patched linux binary after NOAA changed URL for METAR data.
This patch uses additive python script for redirecting to new NOAA URL
Usage :
Backup Your original fgfs.exe
Download this package, extract fgfs.exe and overwrite original one
Run Terminal and use command python3 metar.py. Then start FGFS. 
Based on SurferTim's solution described at https://forum.flightgear.org/viewtopic.php?p=342372#p342372
